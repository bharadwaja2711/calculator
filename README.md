# Calculator

A simple web-based calculator built with **HTML, CSS & JavaScript** — made for fun during my final year.  
Inspired by the iPhone calculator UI (yeah, I copied the look 😅).

---

## What it does
- Basic arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `x`, `/`  
- Percentage (`%`) works like the iPhone calculator:
  - If only the first number is present → `%` converts it to a fraction (e.g. `50` → `0.5`)
  - If you're entering the second number (e.g. `50 + 10`), pressing `%` makes it relative to the first (`10%` of `50` → `5`)
- Decimal support
- `AC` clears everything, `DEL` backspaces
- Stretched `0` button and a subtle home indicator for the Apple vibe

---

## Notes / Design choices
- I tried to match the iPhone calculator feel — layout, button sizes, operator color, and the tiny home indicator.  
- `%` behavior follows the typical calculator convention (relative percent for the second number).  
- The multiply button shows `x` in the UI but the JS maps it to `*` for calculations.

## Fun Stuff

I tried to make it look exactly like the iPhone calculator… I think it’s close enough 😂

This is my final year project-level fun side project

Feel free to fork it and play around with styles or add new features
